## Sub-project Summaries

### 1 — Project Foundation ✅
Scaffold the monorepo, configure all services, set up MCPs, establish design system foundations (tokens + 5 atomic components), CI pipeline, justfile.  
**Done when:** Hello-world running on all services, design system deployed to Chromatic, CI green.

### 2 — Nomenclature & Data Model ✅
Land on the naming hierarchy for data entities, define all field types (numeric, ordinal, multi-response variants), design the Postgres schema, establish the migration system.  
**Done when:** Schema finalised, seed data representing 2–3 real dataset structures, OpenAPI types generated.

### 3 — Analytics Engine 🔜
Cross-tab and trending queries against seed data, table + chart output components, query builder UI, working prototype deployed and accessible via feature flag.  
**Done when:** End-to-end — select dataset → configure analysis → view table + chart — deployed to Vercel/Render.

### 4 — Data Ingestion & Metadata Editor ⏳
File upload (CSV, SPSS), metadata GUI (field types, display names, multi-response config), template from previous dataset instance. Analytics engine serves as the immediate testbed.  
**Done when:** Upload a real dataset → configure metadata → query it in the analytics engine.

### 5 — AI Interface ⏳
NL query → PydanticAI identifies relevant data sources → executes queries in parallel → streams structured results (text + tables + charts) to frontend via Vercel AI SDK. Responses grounded in real data only — no LLM world knowledge.  
**Done when:** Ask "how has X changed over 5 years?" → receive a cited, data-grounded response with tables and charts.
